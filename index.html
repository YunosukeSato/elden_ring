        Rise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the
        Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between. <br />
        <br />
        In the Lands Between ruled by Queen Marika the Eternal, the Elden Ring,
        the source of the Erdtree, has been shattered. <br />
        <br />
        Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring
        known as the Great Runes, and the mad taint of their newfound strength
        triggered a war: The Shattering. A war that meant abandonment by the
        Greater Will. <br />
        <br />
        And now the guidance of grace will be brought to the Tarnished who were
        spurned by the grace of gold and exiled from the Lands Between. Ye dead
        who yet live, your grace long lost, follow the path to the Lands Between
        beyond the foggy sea to stand before the Elden Ring. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        And become the Elden Lord.
